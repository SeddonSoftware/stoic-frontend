            <p>This app revives the timeless practice of Stoicism through the simple yet profound act of daily journaling. Inspired by the personal reflections of Marcus Aurelius in "Meditations," this app is your space to engage in a daily dialogue with yourself, guided by four reflective questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>What did I do well today?</li>
            <li>What did I do poorly today?</li>
            <li>What did I learn today?</li>
            <li>What can I do better tomorrow?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Alongside these questions, there's room for additional notes, allowing you to capture broader insights and observations.</p>
            <p>Marcus Aurelius, one of the most revered Stoic philosophers, kept a personal journal that has enlightened millions over centuries. This app invites you to follow in his footsteps, using daily journaling as a tool to cultivate self-awareness, growth, and resilience. Each entry is a step towards mastering the art of living, as taught by Stoicism, offering you a practical method to reflect, learn, and evolve every day.</p>
